# The Effects of Current Job Status on Subjective Wellbeing

Research has highlighted striking effects of economic disadvantage on both mental and physical health. Experiencing persistent hardship increases the risk of depression, obesity, and diabetes (Everson et al., 2002) and the scarring effect of unemployment has been proven (Clark et al., 2001). This report attempts to provide evidence of the association between labour force status and wellbeing in the UK, with a particular focus on the potential negative effects of unemployment or inability to work. It will also inspect potential gender discrepancies, as discriminatory social norms also affect women’s labour force participation (Jütting et al., 2008). The hypothesis tested is that being unemployed is correlated with higher psychological distress.

### Study Design

This report uses data from the ninth wave 2017-2018) of Understanding Society’s Longitudinal Teaching Dataset which combines the responses from adult (16+) interviews from the General Population and Ethnic Minority Boost samples. The former is a multi-stage clustered and stratified probability sample that includes approximately 24,000 households in the UK. The Boost Samples add 6,200 households selected from areas of high ethnic minority concentration.
